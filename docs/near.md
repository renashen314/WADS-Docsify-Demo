## Feature ideas that could be implemented in one year
  - Having a /docs and /docs/edit path to view and edit the docs as needed

  - Having a /docs/[ROLE] and /docs/[ROLE]/edit to maintain user-level and stakeholder specific documentation

  - A way to add and annotate images with shapes and captions

  - An authentication system (maybe based on shibboleth but could be overkill for docs) to access /docs or /docs/[ROLE]/edit based on information sensitivity

  - Having an ‘admin login’ button on the /docs path navbar

  - Continue as guest could be implemented
