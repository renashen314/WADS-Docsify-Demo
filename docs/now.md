## Workflow for short-term implementation
  - Using docsify, having a /docs path within each WADS application, as a way to access publicly avaliable docs.

  - Securing development specific documentation by making the repository "internal", and adding a README.md at the root of the project directory.

  - Easy editing and updating of documentation, using Github's in-browser editor (press . on Github repo page opens up Github's in-browser editor).
  
  - Consolidation of exsiting documentation, and adoption of proposed template.
