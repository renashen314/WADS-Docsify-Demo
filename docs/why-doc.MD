Docsify is a documentation site generator.

It generates dynamically loads and parses markdown files and displays them on websites.

With a docsify template, our team can easily create, manage, and maintain documentation for apps.

## Documentation is improtant!
For users, it serves as a clear guide. A clean, well designed documentation will decrease confusion, and reduce workload for supports.

Writing documentation is an essential part of open source activities. The better the documentation, the easier it is for users to start working with your library or project. But what is the definition of “better”? Let me narrow it down to just two key metrics:

1. The number of issues asking “How to do X?” or simply saying “It doesn’t work, I don’t know why.”
2. The number of people given up on using your projects because it has no clear quick start instructions.
